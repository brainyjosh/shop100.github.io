For example, when you create an object of a class, it is stored as a reference type.\r\nReference types are stored in a part of the memory called the [b]heap[/b].\r\nWhen you instantiate an object, the data for that object is stored on the heap, while its heap memory address is stored on the stack.\r\nThat is why it is called a reference type - it contains a reference (the memory address) to the actual object on the heap.
