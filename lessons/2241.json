CSS3 has now changed that so they are applied in [b]reverse order[/b]. \r\n\r\nTo create multiple shadows, the shadows are separated with a comma. Here is an example: [code format=\"css\" codeId=\"590\"]h1 {\r\n   text-shadow: 5px 10px 2px #93968f[b],[/b] \r\n      -3px 6px 5px #58d1e3;\r\n}[/code]\r\nThis example defines two text shadows at different locations, blur radius, and colors. This makes it look like there are two different light sources on the text. [img id=\"2677\" width=\"100%\"]\r\nTo make a text shadow look realistic, remember these few shadow characteristics: \r\n\r\n- A shadow which is close to the text is normally not as blurred as a shadow that is far from the text. A shadow that is far from the text usually implies a light source which is also far from the text. \u000b\r\n- A shadow which is close to the text usually implies that the underlying surface is close, that the light is close, or both. A close shadow is often darker than a distant shadow, because less light can get in between the shape and the underlying surface. \r\n[note]To remove a text-shadow, set the text-shadow property to [b]none;[/b] no shadows will be associated with that element.[/note]"}]}}
