Exponentiation has the highest precedence followed by multiplication, division, and modulus from left to right, and then addition and subtraction from left to right.\r\nYou can change the order of operations by using parentheses.\r\n[b]For example: [/b][code format=\"rb\" codeId=\"979\"]x = (3+2) * 4\r\nputs x\r\n# outputs 20[/code]"}]}}
