The name uniquely identifies each variable, assigning a value to the variable and retrieving the value stored.\r\n\r\nVariables have [b]types[/b]. Some examples:\r\n- [b]int[/b]: for integers (whole numbers) such as 123 and -456\r\n- [b]double[/b]: for floating-point or real numbers with optional decimal points and fractional parts in fixed or scientific notations, such as 3.1416, -55.66.\r\n- [b]String[/b]: for texts such as \"Hello\" or \"Good Morning!\". Text strings are enclosed within double quotes.\r\n\r\nYou can declare a variable of a type and assign it a value. Example:[code format=\"java\"]String name = \"David\";[/code]\r\nThis creates a variable called [b]name [/b]of type [b]String[/b], and assigns it the value \"David\".\r\n[note]It is important to note that a variable is associated with a type, and is only capable of storing values of that particular type. For example, an [b]int [/b]variable can store integer values, such as 123; but it cannot store real numbers, such as 12.34, or texts, such as \"Hello\".[/note]"},{"id":4208,"number":2,"videoStart":176.0,"videoEnd":232.0,"linkedVideoID":null,"type":6,"linkedQuizID":null,"tip":null,"hint":null,"time":0,"answers":[{"id":100217,"text":"String","isCorrect":true,"properties":{}},{"id":100218,"text":"int","isCorrect":true,"properties":{}},{"id":100219,"text":"double","isCorrect":true,"properties":{}},{"id":100220,"text":"true","isCorrect":false,"properties":{}},{"id":100221,"text":"class","isCorrect":false,"properties":{}},{"id":100222,"text":"void","isCorrect":false,"properties":{}}],"question":"Fill in the blanks to have a valid Java program.\r\n[!raw!]\r\nclass Apples {\r\n  public static void main(String[ ]args) {\r\n    {0} name = \"John\";\r\n    {1} age = 24;\r\n    {2} height = 189.87;\r\n  }\r\n}","textContent":"[h1]Variables[/h1]\r\n\r\nExamples of variable declarations:[code format=\"java\" codeId=\"718\"]class MyClass {\r\n  public static void main(String[ ] args) {\r\n    [b]String[/b] name =\"David\";\r\n    [b]int[/b] age = 42;\r\n    [b]double [/b]score =15.9;\r\n    [b]char[/b] group = 'Z';\r\n  }\r\n}[/code]\r\n[b]char [/b]stands for character and holds a single character.\r\n\r\nAnother type is the [b]Boolean [/b]type, which has only two possible values: [b]true [/b]and [b]false[/b].\r\nThis data type is used for simple flags that track true/false conditions.\r\n[b]For example:[/b] [code format=\"java\" ][b]boolean [/b]online = true;[/code]\r\n[note]You can use a comma-separated list to declare more than one variable of the specified type.
