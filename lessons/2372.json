As you build apps that are more and more complex, you'll be dealing with greater numbers of [b]scenes[/b]. You will need to have the ability to manage loading and unloading views as they're moved on and off the screen.\r\nAn object of the [b]UIViewController[/b] class, and of its subclasses, comes with a set of methods that serve to manage its view hierarchy. iOS automatically calls the methods at appropriate times when a view controller transitions between states. [img id=\"1023\" width=\"100%\"]\r\n[b]viewDidLoad()[/b]: Called when the view controller's content view is created and loaded from a storyboard. \r\n[b]viewWillAppear()[/b]: Intended for any operations that you want always to occur before the view becomes visible. \r\n[b]viewDidAppear()[/b]: Intended for any operations that you want to occur as soon as the view becomes visible, such as fetching data or showing an animation.\r\n[note]A complementary set of teardown methods exists, as shown in the state transition diagram above.[/note]"}]}}
