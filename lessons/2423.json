[/note]\r\nYou need both of the following components to build C++ programs.\r\n1. [b]Integrated Development Environment (IDE)[/b]: Provides tools for writing source code. Any text editor can be used as an IDE.\r\n2. [b]Compiler[/b]: Compiles source code into the final executable program. There are a number of C++ compilers available. The most frequently used and free available compiler is the [b]GNU C/C++[/b] compiler.\r\n\r\nVarious C++ IDEs and compilers are available. We'll use a free tool called [b]Code::Blocks[/b], which includes both an IDE and a compiler, and is available for Windows, Linux and MacOS.\r\nTo download Code::Blocks, go to http://www.codeblocks.org/, Click the [b]Downloads [/b]link, and choose \"[b]Download the binary release[/b]\".\r\nChoose your OS and download the setup file, which includes the C++ compiler (For Windows, it's the one with [b]mingw [/b]in the name).\r\n[note]Make sure to install the version that includes the [b]compiler[/b].[/note]"},{"id":4939,"number":2,"videoStart":302.0,"videoEnd":458.0,"linkedVideoID":null,"type":1,"linkedQuizID":null,"tip":null,"hint":null,"time":0,"answers":[{"id":117510,"text":"GNU GCC","isCorrect":true,"properties":{}},{"id":117511,"text":"GAC","isCorrect":false,"properties":{}},{"id":117512,"text":"Console","isCorrect":false,"properties":{}},{"id":117513,"text":"CodeBlocks","isCorrect":false,"properties":{}}],"question":"Which of the following is a C++ compiler?","textContent":"[h1]Getting the Tools[/h1]\r\n\r\nTo create a project, open Code::Blocks and click \"[b]Create a new project[/b]\" (or File->New->Project).\r\nThis will open a dialog of project templates.
