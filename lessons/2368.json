Creating a point of entry and a run loop that delivers input events to your app. This work is carried out by the [b]UIApplicationMain attribute [/b](@UIApplicationMain), which appears toward the top of the file. \r\n2. Defining the [b]AppDelegate [/b]class, which serves as the blueprint for the app delegate object. The app delegate creates the window where your app's content is drawn, and provides a place to respond to state transitions within the app. The AppDelegate class is where you write your custom app-level code. It contains a single property, [b]window[/b]. [code format=\"swift\"]var window: UIWindow?[/code]\r\nThe AppDelegate class also contains templates of important methods. These predefined methods allow the application object to talk to the app delegate.[code format=\"swift\"]func application(application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions\r\n      launchOptions: [NSObject: AnyObject]?) -> Bool\r\n\r\nfunc applicationWillResignActive(application: UIApplication)\r\n\r\nfunc applicationDidEnterBackground(application: UIApplication)\r\n\r\nfunc applicationWillEnterForeground(application: UIApplication)\r\n\r\nfunc applicationDidBecomeActive(application: UIApplication)\r\n\r\nfunc applicationWillTerminate(application: UIApplication)[/code]\r\nDuring an app state transition - for example, app launch, transitioning to the background, and app termination - the application object calls the corresponding method in the app delegate, giving it an opportunity to respond appropriately. \r\n[note]A method templates can also be used to add custom code that will execute when the methods are called.[/note]"},{"id":4853,"number":3,"videoStart":0.0,"videoEnd":0.0,"linkedVideoID":null,"type":1,"linkedQuizID":null,"tip":null,"hint":null,"time":0,"answers":[{"id":96748,"text":"ViewController.swift","isCorrect":true,"properties":{}},{"id":96749,"text":"AppDelegate.swift","isCorrect":true,"properties":{}},{"id":96750,"text":"MyApp.swift","isCorrect":false,"properties":{}},{"id":96751,"text":"View.swift","isCorrect":false,"properties":{}}],"question":"The two default source code files in the project are...","textContent":"[h1]The View Controller Source File[/h1]\r\n\r\nSelect [b]ViewController.swift[/b] in the project navigator to view it.
