The fields in a view are fields from one or more real tables in the database.\r\n\r\nViews allow us to:\r\n- Structure data in a way that users or classes of users find natural or intuitive.\r\n- Restrict access to the data in such a way that a user can see and (sometimes) modify exactly what they need and no more.\r\n- Summarize data from various tables and use it to generate reports.\r\n\r\nTo create a view: [code format=\"sql\"][b]CREATE VIEW [/b]view_name [b]AS[/b]\r\nSELECT column_name(s)\r\nFROM table_name\r\nWHERE condition;[/code]\r\n[note]The SELECT query can be as complex as you need it to be.
