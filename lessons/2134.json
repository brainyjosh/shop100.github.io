The Java virtual machine makes this possible.\r\n[note]Basically, the Java compiler reads Java language source (.java) files, translates the source into Java bytecodes, and places the bytecodes into class (.class) files. \r\nThe class files can then be executed on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).[/note]"},{"id":4192,"number":2,"videoStart":489.5,"videoEnd":580.0,"linkedVideoID":null,"type":1,"linkedQuizID":null,"tip":null,"hint":null,"time":0,"answers":[{"id":94899,"text":"All programming languages have virtual machines","isCorrect":false,"properties":{}},{"id":94900,"text":".class files contain abstract instructions for JVM","isCorrect":true,"properties":{}},{"id":94901,"text":"The same bytecode can be run on different JVMs","isCorrect":true,"properties":{}}],"question":"Which two of the following statements are true?","textContent":"[h1]Java Virtual Machine[/h1]\r\n\r\nIn other programming languages, the compiler will typically produce code for a particular system. The Java compiler, however, produces code for a virtual machine. \r\n\r\n- The JVM is a main component of Java architecture, and is part of the JRE (Java Runtime Environment).\r\n- The JVM is operating system-dependent. In other words, the JVM must translate the bytecode into machine language, and the machine language depends on which operating system is being used, which makes the JVM platform-dependent, or operating system-dependent.\r\n- The JVM is responsible for allocating memory needed by the Java program.\r\n[note]Every device that has a JVM installed is able to translate and run your .class files. \r\nThis makes it possible to run the same bytecode on different platforms.[/note]"}]}}
