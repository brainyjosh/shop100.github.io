Place all of the files you want to put in a library in the same parent directory. This directory should also contain a file called [b]__init__.py[/b], which can be blank but must be present in the directory.\r\nThis directory goes into another directory containing the readme and license, as well as an important file called [b]setup.py[/b]. \r\n[b]Example directory structure:[/b] [code format=\"raw\"]SoloLearn/\r\n   LICENSE.txt\r\n   README.txt\r\n   [b]setup.py[/b]\r\n   sololearn/\r\n      [b]__init__.py[/b]\r\n      sololearn.py\r\n      sololearn2.py[/code]\r\n[note]You can place as many script files in the directory as you need.[/note]"},{"id":5204,"number":2,"videoStart":0.0,"videoEnd":0.0,"linkedVideoID":null,"type":2,"linkedQuizID":null,"tip":null,"hint":null,"time":0,"answers":[{"id":88250,"text":"sdist","isCorrect":false,"properties":{"prefix":"python setup.py ","postfix":""}}],"question":"What is the command used for building a source distribution?","textContent":"[h1]Packaging[/h1]\r\n\r\nThe next step in packaging is to write the [b]setup.py[/b] file. \r\nThis contains information necessary to assemble the package so it can be uploaded to [b]PyPI [/b]and installed with [b]pip[/b] (name, version, etc.).\r\nExample of a [b]setup.py[/b] file: [code format=\"raw\"]from distutils.core import setup\r\n\r\nsetup(\r\n   name='SoloLearn', \r\n   version='0.1dev',\r\n   packages=['sololearn',],\r\n   license='MIT', \r\n   long_description=open('README.txt').read(),\r\n)[/code]\r\nAfter creating the [b]setup.py[/b] file, upload it to [b]PyPI[/b], or use the command line to create a binary distribution (an executable installer).\r\nTo build a source distribution, use the command line to navigate to the directory containing setup.py, and run the command [b]python setup.py sdist[/b].\r\nRun[b] python setup.py bdist[/b] or, for Windows,[b] python setup.py bdist_wininst [/b]to build a binary distribution. \r\nUse [b]python setup.py register[/b], followed by[b] python setup.py sdist upload[/b] to upload a package.\r\n[note]Finally, install a package with [b]python setup.py install[/b].[/note]"}]}}
