Some of the standard library's useful modules include [b]string[/b], [b]re[/b], [b]datetime[/b], [b]math[/b], [b]random[/b], [b]os[/b], [b]multiprocessing[/b], [b]subprocess[/b], [b]socket[/b], [b]email[/b], [b]json[/b], [b]doctest[/b], [b]unittest[/b], [b]pdb[/b], [b]argparse [/b]and [b]sys[/b].\r\n\r\nTasks that can be done by the standard library include string parsing, data serialization, testing, debugging and manipulating dates, emails, command line arguments, and much more!\r\n[note]Python's extensive standard library is one of its main strengths as a language.[/note]"},{"id":5030,"number":2,"videoStart":0.0,"videoEnd":0.0,"linkedVideoID":null,"type":1,"linkedQuizID":null,"tip":null,"hint":null,"time":0,"answers":[{"id":87607,"text":"The Standard Library","isCorrect":true,"properties":{}},{"id":87608,"text":"import","isCorrect":false,"properties":{}},{"id":87609,"text":"Unix","isCorrect":false,"properties":{}}],"question":"What name is given to Python's preinstalled modules?","textContent":"[h1]The Standard Library[/h1]\r\n\r\nSome of the modules in the standard library are written in Python, and some are written in C.\r\nMost are available on all platforms, but some are Windows or Unix specific. \r\n[note]We won't cover all of the modules in the standard library; there are simply too many.

This comes installed by default with modern distributions of Python. If you don't have it, it is easy to install online. Once you have it, installing libraries from PyPI is easy. Look up the name of the library you want to install, go to the command line (for Windows it will be the Command Prompt), and enter [b]pip install library_name[/b]. Once you've done this, import the library and use it in your code.\r\n\r\nUsing [b]pip[/b] is the standard way of installing libraries on most operating systems, but some libraries have prebuilt binaries for Windows. These are normal executable files that let you install libraries with a GUI the same way you would install other programs.\r\n[note]It's important to enter [b]pip [/b]commands at the command line, not the Python interpreter.[/note]"}]}}
