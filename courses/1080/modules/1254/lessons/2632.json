The algorithm for MakePyramid is:\r\n1. The first row should contain one star at the top center of the pyramid. The center is calculated based on the number of rows in the pyramid.\r\n2. Each row after the first should contain an odd number of stars (1, 3, 5, etc.), until the number of rows is reached.\r\n\r\nBased on the algorithm, the code will use for loops to display spaces and stars for each row: [code format=\"cs\" codeId=\"810\"]static void DrawPyramid(int n)\r\n{\r\n  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)\r\n  {\r\n    for (int j = i; j <= n; j++)\r\n    {\r\n      Console.Write(\"  \");\r\n    }\r\n    for (int k = 1; k <= 2 * i - 1; k++)\r\n    {\r\n      Console.Write(\"*\" + \" \");\r\n    }\r\n    Console.WriteLine();\r\n  }\r\n}[/code]\r\nThe first [b]for [/b]loop that iterates through each row of the pyramid contains two [b]for [/b]loops.\r\nThe first inner loop displays the spaces needed before the first star symbol. The second inner loop displays the required number of stars for each row, which is calculated based on the formula (2*i-1) where i is the current row.\r\nThe final [b]Console.WriteLine();[/b] statement moves the cursor to the next row.\r\n[note]Now, if we call the [b]DrawPyramid [/b]method, it will display a pyramid having the number of rows we pass to the method.[/note]"}]}}
