To order the elements, use a [b]LinkedHashSet[/b], which maintains a linked list of the set's elements in the order in which they were inserted.\r\n\r\n[b]What is hashing?[/b]\r\nA hash table stores information through a mechanism called hashing, in which a key's informational content is used to determine a unique value called a hash code.\r\nSo, basically, each element in the HashSet is associated with its unique hash code. \r\n[note]You've learned about the various collection types that are available in Java, including [b]Lists[/b], [b]Maps[/b], and [b]Sets[/b].
