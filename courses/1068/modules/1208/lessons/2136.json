These editors are called [b]Integrated Development Environments[/b] (IDE).\r\n\r\n[b]Eclipse [/b]is the most popular IDE for Java. It can be obtained as a free download from [b]www.eclipse.org[/b]. For regular Java programs, choose[b] Eclipse IDE for Java Developers[/b].[b][/b]\r\n[note]Eclipse versions are available for various operating systems.

[/note]\r\nOnce you have downloaded the Eclipse archive, the next step is to decompress the file, which creates an unzipped Eclipse folder.\r\nSince Eclipse has no installer, there will be an executable file in the Eclipse folder (for Windows: [b]eclipse.exe[/b]). Double clicking the file launches Eclipse (this also applies to other operating systems).\r\n\r\nWhen opened for the first time, Eclipse requests that you create a [b]Workspace [/b]folder, where it will store all of your Java programs.\r\nTo create a new Eclipse project, go to [b]File->New->Java Project [/b]and enter a name for it (e.g., MyProject). \r\nYou will see your newly created project at the left/right side of your screen. Click the plus sign next to the folder to expand it, and you'll see a folder called src.\r\nRight click on the src folder, go to New, [b]select [/b]Class, name the class (e.g., MyClass), and click Finish.\r\nHere, we'll use the same example code we used in the previous lesson. [code format=\"java\" codeId=\"715\"]class MyClass {\r\n  public static void main(String[ ] args) {\r\n    System.out.println(\"Hello World\");\r\n  }\r\n}[/code]\r\nYou will now have your project's structure, as follows: [img id=\"2861\" width=\"100%\"]\r\nTo run your code, Click the [b]Run [/b]icon on the top bar, select Run As, and select Java Application.[img id=\"2862\" width=\"100%\"]\r\nIn the [b]Console [/b]window at the bottom of the screen, you should see \"Hello World\". [img id=\"2863\" width=\"100%\"] \r\n[note]If something is wrong with your code, Eclipse automatically displays the errors in the [b]Console [/b]and[b] Problems [/b]windows.[/note]"}]}}
