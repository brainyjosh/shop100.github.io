Simply right click on your [b]src [/b]directory and click New->Package. Give your package a name and click [b]Finish[/b]. \r\nYou will notice that the new package appears in the project directory. Now you can move and create classes inside that package. We have moved our [b]Vehicle[/b], [b]Counter [/b]and [b]Animal [/b]classes to the package [b]samples[/b]. [img id=\"2868\" width=\"50%\"]\r\nWhen you move/create a class in your package, the following code will appear at the top of the list of files.[code format=\"java\" ][b]package [/b]samples;[/code]\r\nThis indicates the package to which the class belongs.\r\nNow, we need to import the classes that are inside a package in our main to be able to use them.\r\nThe following example shows how to use the [b]Vehicle [/b]class of the [b]samples [/b]package. [code format=\"java\" ][b]import samples.Vehicle;[/b]\r\n\r\nclass MyClass {\r\n  public static void main(String[ ] args) {\r\n    Vehicle v1 = new Vehicle();\r\n    v1.horn();\r\n  }\r\n}[/code]\r\nTwo major results occur when a class is placed in a package. First, the name of the package becomes a part of the name of the class.\r\nSecond, the name of the package must match the directory structure where the corresponding class file resides.\r\n[note]Use a wildcard to import all classes in a package.\r\nFor example, [b]import samples.* [/b]will import all classes in the samples package.[/note]"}]}}
