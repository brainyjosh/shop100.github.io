For example, a car is assembled using a metal frame, an engine, tires, and a large number of other parts. This process is called [b]composition[/b].\r\n\r\nIn C++, object composition involves using classes as member variables in other classes.\r\nThis sample program demonstrates composition in action. It contains [b]Person [/b]and [b]Birthday [/b]classes, and each [b]Person [/b]will have a [b]Birthday [/b]object as its member.\r\n[b]Birthday:[/b] [code format=\"cpp\"]class Birthday {\r\n public:\r\n  Birthday(int m, int d, int y)\r\n  : month(m), day(d), year(y)\r\n  { \r\n  }\r\n private:\r\n   int month;\r\n   int day;\r\n   int year;\r\n};[/code]\r\nOur [b]Birthday [/b]class has three member variables.
