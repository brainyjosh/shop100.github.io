Upon entering the loop, the initialization expression is evaluated once, establishing the loop's constants and/or variables.\r\n2. If the condition expression is found to be true when evaluated, the statements in braces are executed to continue code execution.\r\n3. The increment expression is evaluated once all statements have been executed, and code execution returns to Step 2.\r\n[note]Constants and variables in the initialization expression (such as var index = 0) are only valid within the for loop itself. To retrieve the final value of index after the loop ends, you must declare index before the loop begins.[/note]"}]}}
