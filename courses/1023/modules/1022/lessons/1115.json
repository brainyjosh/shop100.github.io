[b]none [/b](the default) ensures that the element will not float. \r\nBelow is an example of an image that is floated to the right. \r\n\r\n[b]The HTML:[/b][code format=\"html\" ]<p><img src=\"css_logo.png\" />\r\nThis paragraph has an image that is floated to the <strong>right.</strong> \r\nIt is highly recommended to add a margin to images so that the text does \r\nnot get too close to the image.
