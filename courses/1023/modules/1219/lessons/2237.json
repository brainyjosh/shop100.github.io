Browser prefixes are used to add new features that may not be part of the final and formal CSS specification. \r\n\r\nFor example, the prefix for Safari and Chrome is [b]-webkit[/b]. The [b]border-radius[/b] property is currently supported in Chrome, Safari, and Mozilla, as long as it is accompanied by the browser prefix.\r\nTo specify the [b]border-radius[/b] in Chrome and Safari, the following syntax is used:[code format=\"css\" codeId=\"579\"][b]-webkit[/b]-border-radius: 24px;[/code]\r\n[b]Result: [/b][img id=\"2664\" width=\"100%\"]\r\nThe prefix is added to the property to make it work in the unsupported browsers. So, you might end up with multiple definitions of the same property, each with the specific browser prefix.\r\n[note]While most browsers today will work without prefixes, it is essential to know these for backwards capability and understanding older codes.[/note]"},{"id":4467,"number":2,"videoStart":160.0,"videoEnd":199.9,"linkedVideoID":null,"type":6,"linkedQuizID":null,"tip":null,"hint":null,"time":0,"answers":[{"id":106601,"text":"-moz","isCorrect":true,"properties":{}},{"id":106602,"text":"border-radius","isCorrect":true,"properties":{}},{"id":106603,"text":"-mozilla","isCorrect":false,"properties":{}},{"id":106604,"text":"-firefox","isCorrect":false,"properties":{}},{"id":106605,"text":"webkit","isCorrect":false,"properties":{}}],"question":"Fill in the missing code to support border-radius in Mozilla Firefox, as well as in Webkit-based browsers.\r\n[!raw!]\r\n.test\r\n{\r\n   -webkit-border-radius: 8px;  \r\n   {0}-{1}: 8px;\r\n}","textContent":"[h1]Browser Prefixes[/h1]\r\n\r\nHere is the list of vendor prefixes for each browser: [img id=\"2665\" width=\"100%\"]\r\n[note]It might feel annoying and repetitive to have to write the properties two to five times to get them to work in all browsers, but it's temporary.
